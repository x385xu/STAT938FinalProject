# 🚔 Stanford Open Policing Project – Florida Analysis

This project analyzes Florida traffic stop data from the [Stanford Open Policing Project (OPP)](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/) to explore fairness, long-term patterns, and behavioral trends in policing. Using statistical analysis and visualization, we address three core questions posed by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA):

1. **Do traffic stops disproportionately target non-white drivers?**
2. **Are there long-term and seasonal patterns in traffic stops?**
3. **Does an officer’s age affect the likelihood of conducting a search?**

---

## 📊 Methods

We used a combination of statistical and time-series methods to answer these questions:

* **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit** – Compare racial search rates to population proportions.
* **Disparity Ratios** – Quantify over- or under-representation of racial groups in searches.
* **STL Decomposition & Breakpoint Analysis** – Detect long-term trends and seasonal patterns in daily stop volumes.
* **Logistic Regression** – Model the relationship between officer age and search likelihood (continuous and grouped).

## 📁 Data

* **Source:** Florida State Patrol data from the Stanford OPP (2010–2019)
* **Size:** \~7.3M traffic stop records → \~572K after cleaning
* **Key Variables:** stop date/time, location, subject/officer demographics, search conducted, outcome, years of service, violation type

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

* **Language:** R
* **Key Packages:**

  * `tidyverse` – Data wrangling & visualization
  * `forecast` – Time series modeling (STL, ARIMA)
  * `strucchange` – Breakpoint detection
  * `ggplot2` – Custom plots & visualizations

---

## 📌 Key Findings

* **Racial Disparities:** Black and Hispanic drivers are searched at rates more than double their population share; White drivers are underrepresented.
* **Long-Term Trends:** Large structural changes align with major policy and data system updates (e.g., e-citation rollout in 2016).
* **Seasonality:** Peaks in late May/early June (Memorial Day, start of summer) and dips during major holidays.
* **Officer Age Effect:** Officers aged 25–40 are more likely to conduct searches; likelihood drops significantly after age 45.

## 📷 Visual Highlights

Some of our main visualizations include:

* Disparity ratios by race
* STL decomposition of traffic stops
* Seasonal patterns (annual & weekly)
* Search rates by officer age group

## 📚 Future Work

* County-level disparity analysis
* Explore arrest rates and officer–subject demographic combinations
* Address unbalanced outcome variable in logistic regression
* Incorporate causal inference methods
